        This one is for all my fried food lovers out there. Actually, it's for all my delicious food lovers out there! If you've never tried a Japanese fried pork cutlet, or popularly known as tonkatsu, then you are missing out my friend! The exterior crust is so wonderful and crispy, yet the meat inside is incredibly juicy and tender. And what makes this dish extra special you ask? It's the use of one of the greatest food inventions ever: Panko bread crumbs! This is different from the regular breadcrumbs we find in the regular grocery stores. Panko breadcrumbs are a lot crispier and airier, which gives the dish a lot more crunch and texture and we absolutely love it!

        This dish is super easy and straightforward to make, and it doesn't take much time at all. 
        You can follow the recipe that we posted below to make it, but here are a couple of tips and pointers to make your tonkatsu.

                Cook the ramen noodles according to packaging's instructions.

            <li>
                To make the eggs, fill a small deep pot with water, making sure there is enough water for the eggs to submerge in. 
                Bring the water to a boil over medium high heat. Prepare a bowl of iced water and set aside. 
                Once the water is boiling, take eggs out of the fridge and gently put them in the water, and reduce heat to medium to maintain a gentle boil. Cook the eggs for 7 minutes. After 7 minutes, take the eggs out of the boiling water and immediately submerge them in the bowl of iced water. Let cool for at least 10 minutes. 
                Peel of the egg shells thoroughly and set aside for topping.

                Add the low-sodium soy sauce, sesame oil, garlic powder, and brown sugar into the bowl of mushroom and combine well until the brown sugar is well dissolved. 
                Heat canola oil on a pan over medium high heat, and stir fry the mushrooms for 3-5 minutes, or until cooked. 
                Remove from heat and set aside.

            <li>To make dashi broth, heat 4 cups of water in a pot over medium high heat. Once the water simmers, add in 2 tbsp of dashi stock powder and mix well. Let water simmer until the dashi stock powder is well dissolved. Remove from heat and transfer dashi broth into a bowl and set aside.</li>
            <li>To make the ramen broth, heat 2 tbsp of canola oil in a pot over medium heat. Add in the minced garlic, 5 tbsp of mild miso paste and 3 tsp of gochujang.
