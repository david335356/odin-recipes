        This one is for all my fried food lovers out there. Actually, it's for all my delicious food lovers out there! 
        If you've never tried a Japanese fried pork cutlet, or popularly known as tonkatsu, then you are missing out my friend! 
        The exterior crust is so wonderful and crispy, yet the meat inside is incredibly juicy and tender. And what makes this dish extra special you ask? 
        It's the use of one of the greatest food inventions ever: Panko bread crumbs! This is different from the regular breadcrumbs we find in the regular grocery stores. Panko breadcrumbs are a lot crispier and airier, which gives the dish a lot more crunch and texture and we absolutely love it!

        This dish is super easy and straightforward to make, and it doesn't take much time at all. 
        You can follow the recipe that we posted below to make it, but here are a couple of tips and pointers to make your tonkatsu.

        <h4>Ingredients</h4>
        <ul>
            <strong>Fried Pork Cutlet (Tonkatsu)</strong>
                <li>1 boneless pork chop about 1/2 thick</li>
                <li>1/2 cup all-purpose flour</li>
                <li>1/2 cup Panko breadcrumbs</li>
                <li>1 egg</li>
                <li>Salt and pepper to taste</li>
                <li>Shredded cabbage for topping</li>
                <br>
            <strong>Tonkatsu Sauce</strong>
                <li>1 tbsp Ketchup</li>
                <li>2 tsp Worcestershire sauce</li>
                <li>2 tsp oyster sauce</li>
                <li>2 tsp soy sauce</li>
                <li>1 tsp mirin</li>
        </ul>
        <h4>Instructions</h4>
        
        <ol>
            <li>On a cutting board, make slits around one side of the pork chop. Using a meat pounder, pound the meat evenly. Try to keep the pork around 1/2 inch thick.
            </li>
            <li>Prepare the breading stations. Whisk a whole egg in a bowl. Pour the all-purpose flour and the Panko breadcrumbs in two separate plates.
            </li>
            <li>Dip the pork cutlet in the egg, then coat with flour. Once fully coated, dip the cutlet in the egg mixture again, and coat with Panko breadcrumbs until fully coated. If you want a thicker crust, you can dip the cutlet in the egg once more and coat it with Panko again.
            </li>
            <li>In a frying pan, heat oil for shallow fry at medium high to high heat. Once it reaches 350 degrees Fahrenheit (or you can check by throwing in a breadcrumb and see if it bubbles), fry the breaded pork cutlet for about 1 1/2 minutes on each side. Once ready, remove from oil and drain off excess oil by letting it rest on a drying rack or vertically on a paper towel.
            </li>
            <li>To make the tonkatsu sauce, mix together in a bowl the Ketchup, Worcestershire sauce, oyster sauce, miring, and sauce sauce.
            </li>
            
        </ol>
