        Kimchi Bokkeumbap is the equivalent to Chinese Fried rice. Is it a very common dish in South Korea and every household cooks it. It is also very popular amongst the younger generation, as it is an easy and cheap dish to make.

        The other reason why it's also a very popular dish, it that although it is very easy to make, it is complex in flavor and texture. The mixture of the Kimchi juice and gochujang makes it spicy, sour, salty and a little bit sweet, while the rice makes it soft and chewy and the Kimchi adds a lot of crunchiness! The least we can see is that... it packs a punch!
